# IoT Smart Garden Monitor with ESP8266 and Firebase

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for building a DIY Smart Garden Monitor using ESP8266 microcontroller and Firebase. The project includes a soil moisture sensor to monitor the moisture levels in your garden and leverages Firebase for real-time data storage and visualization.

## Features
- **Soil Moisture Sensing:** Utilize a soil moisture sensor to measure the moisture content in the soil.
- **ESP8266 Integration:** Connect the ESP8266 NodeMCU to the soil moisture sensor for data acquisition and transmission.
- **Firebase Cloud Integration:** Establish communication with Firebase to store and retrieve real-time data from the cloud.
- **Web-Based Data Visualization:** Use Firebase's web console to visualize and monitor soil moisture levels through dynamic charts and graphs.

## Getting Started
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the accompanying [YouTube tutorial](<insert your YouTube link>) to build and set up your own Smart Garden Monitor.

## Requirements
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
